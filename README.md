During this course, we had four projects and three exams (two midterms and one final). There was also
a weekly lab to go with the course.

Scores as follows:
hw1 - 105/100
hw2 - 198/200
hw3 - 195/300 (complier errors; ran out of time)
hw4 - 221/300 (hierarchy errors caused crashes; ran out of time)
